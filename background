I come from a family of programmers my father worked at General Motors and City Bank, and my mother [Placeholder] so it's no wonder that even when I was a very young I used to use "Redstone" in Minecraft to do logic for "Mini Games" in Minecraft for my online friends to play. As I got older, I eventually got access to "Command Blocks", these acted as an interface to Minecraft's built-in scripting engine. slowly, but surely through experimentation I started to write simple, and then eventually, very complex scripts that were optimized to run within the confines of the game engine. eventually though, I moved on to coding in the Unity Game Engine, almost to the exclusion of Minecraft. The images used in the background were generated using shader code I wrote in HLSL for Unity, and the constituent parts of the images were combined using a tool I built in unity written in C# here is the <a class="normal" href="https://github.com/IsaiahTaberIT/PlanetaryPlatformer/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/TextureMaker.cs", target="_blank">Tool Code</a>, and here are the  <a class="normal", href="https://github.com/IsaiahTaberIT/PlanetaryPlatformer/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/ComputeShaders/Resources", target="_blank">Shaders</a>. this is my first website (which is probably evident from it's some-what gaudy appearence), im making it to act as a portfolio for my code so I have some evidence of the stuff I work on: my projects can be found here: [Link PlaceHolder]
